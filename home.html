                Hey there! I’m Diego, a freshman at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE), where I’m diving into the world of mechanical engineering. Along with my studies, I currently work as a maintenance technician at Advanced Plating Company, where I gain hands-on experience solving real-world mechanical problems. I’m someone who thrives on learning new things, whether it's improving my skills in engineering, picking up a new coding language, or mastering a new guitar riff. When I’m not immersed in my studies or tinkering with machinery, you’ll probably find me on the basketball court, at the gym bodybuilding, or exploring ways to combine my passion for technology with my hobbies. Whether it's fixing complex systems or building my personal skills, I’m always eager to push the limits and take on new challenges. I believe in the power of continuous learning and growth, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat or connect!
